# Core Web Vitals optimization

Targeted optimization for the three Core Web Vitals using field data to identify user impact and browser traces to diagnose causes.

## The three metrics

| Metric | Measures | Good | Needs work | Poor |
|--------|----------|------|------------|------|
| **LCP** | Loading | ≤ 2.5s | 2.5s – 4s | > 4s |
| **INP** | Interactivity | ≤ 200ms | 200ms – 500ms | > 500ms |
| **CLS** | Visual Stability | ≤ 0.1 | 0.1 – 0.25 | > 0.25 |

Google measures at the **75th percentile** — 75% of page visits must meet "Good" thresholds.

## LCP: Largest Contentful Paint

LCP measures when the largest visible content element renders. Usually this is:
- Hero image or video
- Large text block
- Background image
- `<svg>` element

### Common LCP issues

**1. Slow server response (TTFB > 800ms)**
```
Fix: CDN, caching, optimized backend, edge rendering
```

**2. Render-blocking resources**
```html
<!-- ❌ Blocks rendering -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/all-styles.css">

<!-- ✅ Critical CSS inlined, rest deferred -->
<style>/* Critical above-fold CSS */</style>
<link rel="preload" href="/styles.css" as="style" 
      onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">
```

**3. Slow resource load times**
```html
<!-- ❌ LCP image is discovered only after a stylesheet loads -->
<div class="hero"></div>

<!-- ✅ Discoverable in initial HTML and prioritized -->
<link rel="preload" href="/hero.webp" as="image" fetchpriority="high">
<img src="/hero.webp" alt="Hero" fetchpriority="high">
```

Prefer a discoverable `<img>` with `fetchpriority="high"`. Add the preload only when the trace shows that the resource would otherwise be discovered late; duplicate or speculative preloads can compete for bandwidth.

### LCP optimization checklist

```markdown
- [ ] TTFB < 800ms (use CDN, edge caching)
- [ ] LCP resource is discoverable in initial HTML and prioritized; preload only if the trace shows late discovery
- [ ] LCP image optimized (WebP/AVIF, correct size)
- [ ] Critical CSS inlined (< 14KB)
- [ ] No render-blocking JavaScript in <head>
- [ ] Fonts don't block text rendering (font-display: swap)
- [ ] LCP element in initial HTML (not JS-rendered)
```

## INP: Interaction to Next Paint

INP measures responsiveness across clicks, taps, and key presses during a visit. Diagnose its input delay, processing time, and presentation delay separately; a slow interaction may involve main-thread contention before the handler, expensive application work, or delayed rendering after it.

When field INP is poor or a trace identifies a slow interaction, read [the INP reference](references/INP.md) for trace interpretation, yielding patterns, third-party and rendering causes, a single-session observer, and first-party attribution.

---

## CLS: Cumulative Layout Shift

CLS measures unexpected layout shifts across a page visit. Use field attribution or a trace to identify the shifted node and the trigger; do not assume the visible victim caused the shift.

When field CLS is poor or a trace reports shifts, read [the CLS reference](references/CLS.md) for reserved-space patterns, dynamic content, font and animation fixes, a debugging observer, and a verification checklist.

## Framework quick fixes

### React
```jsx
// LCP: Preload in head
<link rel="preload" href="/hero.jpg" as="image" fetchpriority="high" />

// INP: Memoize and useTransition
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
startTransition(() => setExpensiveState(newValue));

// CLS: Always specify dimensions in img tags
```
